How is investing different from savings?
Both the words are often used similarly, but there’s a lot of difference between the two. The most important difference is associated with risk. If you are saving, there is very little risk of losing funds, and you can easily pull out the money when needed. However, when you invest, there’s a better chance for long term rewards or gains, but also, it is accompanied by a greater risk for loss. 
The second difference is linked with interest. While the aim of investing is to make more money, the reason we opt for savings is for keeping the money secure for future use. 
Why should women start investing?
1.	Investment doubles the money over the years. For example, if you’ve chosen mutual funds, you would be investing for a long time, and you’ll get twice the money. However, the most important factor is risk. So, one must do proper research on a scheme before investing. Women are entering into the fields of business with the help of Startup Business Loans for Women and are growing rapidly. As the rate of income is increasing, the need to invest is equally rising. 
2.	As we know, men are more confident regarding their investment knowledge than women. This is why women should invest more in order to gain practical knowledge. Once women get a clear picture of investments, handling money will become easier.
3.	Being independent is yet another factor that makes investment necessary for women. Regardless of their marriage expectation or marital status, women should be able to take their responsibility. Women who are starting from zero can access Affordable Personal Loans provided by organizations and banks to make investments and get wealthy returns.



4.	It is likely for women to face unpaid leaves and maternity leaves at a point in time. You might find it difficult to take financial responsibility for yourself and your family. During such times, investments become your rescuer. Managing uncertainties becomes easier when you have something to fall back on.
5.	If you’re working, you know the monthly salary is fixed. However, in investments, there’s no limit. Here, the smarter you plan out, the more you earn. Before investing, learn about what’s share market, which share is at the top and how it is going, and then make investments accordingly. There are agencies providing concession of about 2-3% on Women Entrepreneur Loans. 



How to set up an effective financial plan?
Set up a budget
 
The best way to take control of all your expenses is to set up a budget. You need to set up a monthly as well as an annual budget.
